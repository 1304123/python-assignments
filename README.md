# Python Assignments
The repository comprises assignment designs crafted for academic Python classes! 

## Project Introduction:

In today's professional landscape, efficient employee data management is crucial across various industries. Whether it's maintaining accurate records, updating information, or generating insightful reports, having a robust system is essential.

Python, known for its simplicity and versatility, is well-suited for such tasks. Its clear syntax and extensive library support make it a powerful tool for building applications that handle data effectively.

To set the context for the project, build a console application tailored for managing employee information. This application will empower users to perform a variety of operations, including:

- Adding new employees to the system
- Deleting existing employees from the records
- Updating employee details as needed
- Generating comprehensive reports based on various criteria

To ensure data persistence, use a text file as the storage mechanism. This approach provides a practical solution and also allows us to explore file handling concepts in Python.

Let's embark on this academic journey to explore Python's capabilities in managing employee data and hone your programming skills along the way!

## Functional Requirements

This section outlines the key functionalities expected from the application and provides guidance on implementation details.

### Expected Functionalities:
1. **Adding Employee Information:** Users should be able to add new employee details to the system, including attributes such as ID, first name, last name, date of birth, department, and salary.

2. **Deleting Employee Information:** Users should have the capability to delete existing employee records from the system based on unique identifiers such as employee ID.

3. **Updating Employee Information:** Users should be able to modify existing employee details as needed, allowing for changes in attributes such as first name, last name, date of birth, department, and salary.

4. **Data Persistence with Text File:** The application should interact with a text file to store employee data persistently. This ensures that the information remains accessible across different sessions of the application.

### Specified Fields for Employee Information:
- **For Adding and Updating:** The following fields are required: ID, first name, last name, date of birth, department, and salary.

### Reports:
- Implement the following report functionalities:
    1. List of departments.
    2. List of all employees with ID, full name, and department.
    3. List of all departments with "the Average age and salary of all employees in each department.
    4. List of employees in each department with ID, full name, date of birth, salary, and total salary for department's employees.

### Implementation Guidance:
- **Utilization of Python Data Structures:** Utilize Python's built-in data structures such as lists and dictionaries to handle employee data efficiently. Lists can manage collections of employee records, while dictionaries can represent individual employee information, with keys corresponding to different attributes.

- **File Handling:** Implement functions or methods to read from and write to the text file. Python provides intuitive file handling capabilities that allow for seamless integration with the application.

Adhering to these functional requirements and implementation guidelines will result in a comprehensive employee management system that effectively handles employee data and generates insightful reports.
